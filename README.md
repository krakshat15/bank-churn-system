# Bank-s-Churn-Prediction
The code runs on a Jupyter Notebook compiler has provided with test data base installed.
Predicts churn rate or the retention rate for the customer in a bank.
The data set has these undergiven values for a customer customer_id,vintage,age,gender,dependents,occupation,city,customer_nw_category,branch_code,days_since_last_transaction,current_balance,previous_month_end_balance,average_monthly_balance_prevQ,average_monthly_balance_prevQ2,current_month_credit,previous_month_credit,current_month_debit,previous_month_debit,current_month_balance,previous_month_balance
Using these values the code will predict 0 or 1 as a churn rate 0 as a no churn and 1 mean the customer will retain.
#the .iypnb file and .csv file should be in the same folder before execution of the code.
#the dataset which i have provided is already with a churn rate before execution make sure to make those values null.
